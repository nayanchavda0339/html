                The Delhi Capitals (DC) squad for the 2024 season in the Indian Premier League (IPL) comprises a mix of experienced players and promising talents. Let’s take a closer look at the players who will represent the Delhi Capitals:

            <hr>
            <aside>
                <p>Coach : Ricky Ponting</p>
                <p>Captain : Rishabh Pant</p>
                <p>Vice Captain : Axer Patel</p>

                <hr>
            </aside>
            <h4>strengths</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>David Warner and Prithvi Shaw form a formidable opening pair. Shaw’s recent performances in England’s 2023 One-Day Cup have been extraordinary, while Warner’s contributions in Australia’s title victory are promising. Expect aggressive starts from these two</li>
                <li>At number three, Mitchell Marsh adds power-hitting capability to the top order. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>weakness</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>DC needs reliable finishers who can close out games under pressure. Players like Axar Patel need to step up in this role.</li>
            </ul>

                The Punjab Kings (PBKS) have assembled a balanced squad for the 2024 season of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Their team combines experienced international players with promising domestic talents, aiming for a strong campaign. Let’s take a closer look at the PBKS squad:
            </p>
            <hr>
            <aside>
                <p>Coach : Trevor Bayliss</p>
                <p>Captain : Shikhar Dhawan</p>
                <p>Vice Captain : Sam Curran</p>
                <p>Home Ground : Mullanpur Stadium </p>
                <hr>
            </aside>
            <h4>strengths</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Star-Studded Batting Unit: PBKS boasts illustrious batters in their lineup. Players like Shikhar Dhawan, Jonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Sikandar Raza, and Sam Curran bring vast international experience and batting brilliance to the team.
                </li>
                <li>Talented Finishers: PBKS has power hitters such as Jitesh Sharma and Liam Livingstone. These players can deliver match-finishing moments with their aggressive batting style.
                </li>
                <li>Quality Pace Attack: After the 2024 auction, PBKS’ pace attack looks formidable. Kagiso Rabada, Arshdeep Singh, and Sam Curran are already part of the team. Harshal Patel, with his extensive experience, adds depth to the pace department.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>weakness</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited Spin-Bowling Options: PBKS didn’t acquire experienced spinners in the auction despite the spin department’s lack of quality. In 2023, Rahul Chahar and Harpreet Brar struggled to provide breakthroughs. Strengthening the spin attack remains a challenge for PBKS12.
                </li>
