                <li>Aggressive Top Order:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        CSK boasts a formidable top order with players like Ruturaj Gaikwad, Devon Conway, and Shivam Dube.</li>

                The Punjab Kings (PBKS) have assembled a balanced squad for the 2024 season of the Indian Premier League (IPL). Their team combines experienced international players with promising domestic talents, aiming for a strong campaign. Let’s take a closer look at the PBKS squad:
            </p>
            <hr>
            <aside>
                <p>Coach : Trevor Bayliss</p>
                <p>Captain : Shikhar Dhawan</p>
                <p>Vice Captain : Sam Curran</p>
                <p>Home Ground : Mullanpur Stadium </p>
                <hr>
            </aside>
            <h4>strengths</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Star-Studded Batting Unit: PBKS boasts illustrious batters in their lineup. Players like Shikhar Dhawan, Jonny Bairstow, Rilee Rossouw, Sikandar Raza, and Sam Curran bring vast international experience and batting brilliance to the team.
                </li>
                <li>Talented Finishers: PBKS has power hitters such as Jitesh Sharma and Liam Livingstone. These players can deliver match-finishing moments with their aggressive batting style.
                </li>
                <li>Quality Pace Attack: After the 2024 auction, PBKS’ pace attack looks formidable. Kagiso Rabada, Arshdeep Singh, and Sam Curran are already part of the team. Harshal Patel, with his extensive experience, adds depth to the pace department.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>weakness</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited Spin-Bowling Options: PBKS didn’t acquire experienced spinners in the auction despite the spin department’s lack of quality. In 2023, Rahul Chahar and Harpreet Brar struggled to provide breakthroughs. Strengthening the spin attack remains a challenge for PBKS12.
                </li>
